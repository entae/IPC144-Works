This workshop was a helpful way for me to understand how to write in basic C language syntax. I had to try and submit the lab component several times because I was writing the functions inside the main function in the wrong syntax. This helped me experience how Fardad had mentioned that coding is an “exact science.” Submitting the assignment also helped to become a little more familiar with git pushing and pulling. For the DIY part of the workshop it was interesting to see that a float number always displays the partial values even if the value is 0 (ex. 0.00). Comparing that to the example in the workshop guidelines, I realized that the value was to be set as an integer value instead, which I thought was an interesting learning experience. Learning how to loop 60 “-” dashes was also very useful compared to manually pressing my keyboard 60 times.
