This workshop was definitely an exercise for me to enhance my ability to read through the logic in my code. At first, I had trouble trying to understand how the function "scanf" worked and had to rewatch the lecture recordings. Once I was familiarized with how scanf returns values, I could then use that to try and analyze which values were being returned by my functions to then filter out which user responses I did not want. 
I was also able to nest and if else statements within my getIntMM and getDoubleMM functions. This helped me be more aware of how I should set up my conditions and in which order my functions get called. 
Since this workshop will be used later on by calling the header file through utils.h, I hope to continually update and optimize my functions to be more readable and applicable to a variety of solutions.
