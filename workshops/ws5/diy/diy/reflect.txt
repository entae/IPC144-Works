I found this DIY was more approachable compared to our previous workshops, as it was very similar to our lab component, as well as our workshop where we had to create getMMInt. Although the lab component of the workshop helped to set the basic structure of the report at the end, it was fun to implement the getMMInt function. Nothing about how getMMInt rejected certain values were new, but setting limits and displaying a string array for it to display lines such as [0<=Mark<=100] was fun to see, as it displayed how the function could be used repeatedly in more diverse ways. Adhering the value from the getMMInt function to a array value by calling array values with [i] was also interesting to see work in conjunction within a loop function. Another thing that caught my interest was how arrays could be called as functions, therefore not requiring an '&' adhere symbol when using with a placeholder in a string, like how subjectCode could be scanned as scanf("%s", subjectCode) instead of as ("%s", &subjectCode). Overall this workshop proved to be a fun assignment to see how arrays could be used alongside some of the functions we've already coded to apply in more diverse environments.
