This workshop has helped me fully understand how to make use of variables and function arguments alongside loop functions. It was difficult at first but learning to make the line function loop based on char and int arguments made the function more useful for a wider range of commands. Making the loop in the line function also helped to learn the process of making the sum value loop for the price of the items in the shopping function.
Similarly, it was fun to make the rectangle in the diy part of ws2 by nesting a loop function based on the 'width' within the loop function based on 'height'. 
It seems like I need to assign the function arguments to individual variables or XCode won't run the code. This made me wonder if there were ways to incorporate the arguments like "buttomLeft" directly into the code without variables.
