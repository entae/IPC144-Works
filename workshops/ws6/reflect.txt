This workshop was an interesting way to work with structs and files. While it was cool to see that the code could work directly from a file instead of user input, it also added more complications. 
While formatting the fscanf in the loadMovie function was also good practice with which characters the fscanf should read up-to and also skip over. I ran into an issue where the movie title would constantly have a new line before it's characters for every movie other than the first one. I figured the new line in the movies.dat file was not only a simple '\n' but maybe a combination of "new line" + "go to the beginning." Due to this added complication I searched and found that I could use a '%*c' to dismiss a character being read from the file. At first I tried to add it to the beginning of the fscanf since that was where the trouble was occurring. However, this would work for every line except the first movie, where the first character of "The Godfather" was missing. So, I added it to the end of the format specifier so that it would remove the extra character I was missing before scanning the next package in the struct. 
After the next lecture from this workshop, I realized I can also implement an fflush function and will practice using it as well.
